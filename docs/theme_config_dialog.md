## Visualizer Theme Editor

![Theme_Config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/master/images/color_theme_editor.png)

This editor is organized in a three-level hierarchy:
1. Themes
2. Styles
3. Style Definition

* The _Theme Label_ field will accept Unicode characters.

* The color swatches in the Styles and Styles Definition section are clickable.

* Changes in the Style Definition section will disable change of selections at the Styles and Theme levels until the changes are accepted or reset or the themes file is saved or reloaded.

* Previous configurations are automatically backed up with each save. Use _Load Backup Themes File_ to load a backup file.

**Trivia**: The quirky sentences displayed in the _Output_ box are [*Pangrams*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram). Clicking on the _Output_ box will randomly shuffle through the embedded set.
